- NOTE: Many built-in JavaScript data structures, such as arrays and maps, already implement the iterator pattern, so you can use for...of loops to iterate over them directly.

- learn:
  The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) to provide a consistent way to iterate over a collection of elements without exposing the underlying details of the collection's implementation. It decouples the client code from the specific data structures, making it easier to work with various types of collections in a uniform manner.

  Let me break down the concept of "providing a consistent way to iterate over a collection of elements without exposing the underlying details of the collection's implementation" in the context of the Iterator Pattern:

  - Consistent Way to Iterate: The Iterator Pattern offers a standardized method for going through the elements of a collection, such as an array or a list. Instead of each collection having its own unique way to loop through its elements, the Iterator Pattern defines a common interface (methods like next() and hasNext()) that all collections can use.

  - Without Exposing Implementation Details: When you use a collection (like an array), you don't usually need to know how the collection is structured internally, such as how it stores its elements in memory or how it manages its size. The Iterator Pattern allows you to iterate through the elements without having to be concerned about these low-level implementation details.

To put it simply, think of a collection like a book with pages. You want to read the book, but you don't need to know how the book is bound or how the pages are printed and organized. Instead, you just turn pages (iterate) one by one using a consistent method (like flipping pages) without worrying about the book's internal structure.

The Iterator Pattern provides a layer of abstraction that hides the nitty-gritty details of how the collection works internally, allowing you to focus on the higher-level task of iterating through its elements. This separation of concerns makes your code more maintainable and less dependent on the specific details of the collection's implementation.
